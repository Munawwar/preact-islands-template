# preact-islands-template

Example repo to start a [island architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) website with Preact and Fastify.

- <span aria-hidden>üêá</span> No build
- <span aria-hidden>ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span> Fastify server (HTTP2)
- <span aria-hidden>üîÑ</span> Live reload on dev
- <span aria-hidden>üåê</span> Static files deployable to S3 behind a CDN

NOTE: This template only works with latest node.js 18 (tested on v18.18+, didn't work on v18.17), node.js 20 (v20.6+) due to its reliance on experimental loader for busting dynamic `import()` cache.

## Dev setup

For HTTP/2 to work, a self-signed certificate and key need to be created:

```sh
mkdir certs
cd certs
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

Then

```sh
npm ci

# Dev
npm run dev

# Prod
npm run start
```

VSCode note: Install [es6-string-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobermory.es6-string-html) extension to syntax highlight HTML inside of JS template literals.

## Structure

Example server uses a config file for mapping URL pattern to server handling function. Config file is at `server/routes.js`. This gives full flexibility on how routes and URLs are handled.

Entry files to a page should placed in `client/pages/{name}/{name}.page.js`. Entry files should server render the entire page's HTML, that can optionally include islands from `client/pages/{name}/{name}.islands.js`.

Islands javascript will be loaded on the client side. Other than islands javascript, no other javascript from \*.page.js will load on the client side.

You will have to do at least a couple of things to production-ize this template:

1. Use an SSL certificate on prod (have a look at [letsencrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acme-client)).
2. You may not want to have a single preact context for the entire website. Each page having a separate context might be better.
3. Optionally add CDN configured to cache everything under `public/` URL path. OR upload files from `/public` directory to a file storage origin (like AWS S3 bucket) at path `/public/<hash>` (the hash can be computed using `npm run hash` command and it outputs the hash to stdout and `server/hash.txt` file) and then configure CDN to fetch `/public/*` (on the same domain as the fastify server) from the file storage origin. Also remove fastify compression and enable dynamic compression on the CDN.

## "No build" pros and cons

Pros

- Don't have to mess with a build tool. Simpler local development setup and CI steps.

Cons

- Every change to `/public` directory will create a new hash and so more cache misses will happen on every release. It's not too much of a problem especially with CDN maxage / s-maxage headers (CDNs will cache the files for a PoP - point of presence - and serve files to all users in the area without making a hit to origin server. You can reduce even more load with Cloudflare tiered caching or AWS origin shield).
- Browser needs to support [import maps](https://caniuse.com/import-maps). Not a problem if you don't support older browsers.
- More chances of waterfall requests when importing JS. Especially if you have lots of nested imports. HTTP/2 can only mitigate the effects of this a bit. But again this is an "islands" template. I expect less JS. If your "island" is as big as Australia then isn't that a continent?
- Component props within `htm` tagged template literals cannot be type checked (it is probably possible as [typescript-lit-html-plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-lit-html-plugin/tree/main) exists, but as of now no one seem to have tried implementing it).
